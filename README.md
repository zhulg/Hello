Hello
=====
If you include a file with the filename "README" in your repository, it will automatically be shown on your repository's front page. Pretty cool, huh? GitHub supports a number of different README formats. The one in this tutorial will result in a basic text file but other formats like .markdown or .textile can be used to render HTML content like links and headers. For more info about the supported markup formats, check out https://github.com/github/markup.
